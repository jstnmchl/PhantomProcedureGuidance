# PhantomProcedureGuidance

Slicer extension to facillitate guidance of a phantom brachytherapy procedure using a 3D US guidance system as part of my master's thesis.
Extension consists of two modules: 
1) Segmentation: Streamline a simple segmentation algorithm (connected thresholding) suitable for an agar ultrasound phantom
2) Registration and Plan Export: Registration of the segmented phantom to a segmentation that corresponds to the phantom radiation treatment plan. 
The registered plan is then exported to be compatible with in-house software for the 3D US scanner.
